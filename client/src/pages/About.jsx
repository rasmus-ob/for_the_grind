					The statistics are significant to be on top of because they can make
					the difference between you making it or face-planting with your head
					first in the ground. Contemplate this. Who do you think will be more
					successful? The person who just free balls everything or the person
					that takes notes and peeks at the data, too consistently improve?
					Probably the last option right?

					We make it effortless to record and understand statistics, through
					graphs and data. The diagrams make it easy to see where you lack and
					recognize where you need to put in more effort before it harms your
					progress.

					When you can take part in the statistics with ease, you are much more
